# Keshav blog

**About this project**

This is the first project I created. The site consists of a single HTML file and a CSS file.

The site (including images) is small and lightweight, and features beautiful backgrounds and a calm but modern color scheme.

### How to run 

1. Download or clone this repository.

2. Double click or drag the index.html file into your browser of choice.

### Contribution

All pull requests are more than welcome. 

### Motivate your self to contribute

I have a personal philosophy in life: If somebody else can do something that I'm doing, they should do it. And what I want to do is find things that would represent a unique contribution to the world - the contribution that only I, and my portfolio of talents, can make happen. Those are my priorities in life.
